## ðŸ‘‘ Fro-Yo Queen ðŸ‘‘

I recently got into making my own Greek-style yogurt at home. I
think it's great and I'm really entertained by making regular use
of my Instant Pot. Not satisfied with only having yogurt, I deci-
ded I needed to take it to the next level..... the dessert level.
So, I used ([this recipe I found](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-frozen-yogurt-recipe-223055))
to start making my own frozen yogurt. I'm proud on top of proud.
Here's a real cute pic of the first serving.
